This application enables the transcription of archive cards from the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) Nubian Sondage survey
between 1960 - 1961. Images will be drawn from the EES Flickr feed and redisplayed in the browser window. The EES would 
like the following information to be transcribed for them to create a searchable archive for their records. 

These fields are:

* Season date
* Record number
* Description
* Provenance
* Time period (if given)
* Scale of image
* Your comments or other information

The object cards have been scanned by EES volunteers.
